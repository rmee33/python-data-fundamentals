# Python Data Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains small, focused Python examples that demonstrate
core programming concepts commonly used in analytics workflows.

The examples emphasize:
- clarity and readability
- correct handling of common data issues
- simple functions and clean control flow

All examples are self-contained and use synthetic inputs.

---

## Topics Covered
- Loops and iteration (for-loops, enumerate, range)
- String cleaning and transformation
- Input parsing and validation
- Collections (lists, tuples, nested lists) and unpacking
- Practical "mini project" combining multiple concepts
